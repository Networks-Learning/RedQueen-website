      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        User attention is becoming a sparse commodity. This is evinced by the
        proliferation of studies which point at information overload or at the
        plethora of articles proclaiming to recommend when to post your messages
        to maximise the probability of your followers reacting to the post.
        <!-- Can give references here -->
      </p>

      <p>
        We will look at <span class="us">one broadcaster</span> who wants his
        posts to gain more user attention and see how he can regulate his
        posting to do that.
      </p>

      <h2>Feeds in social media</h2>
      <p>
        Feeds in social media display posts of all <em>followees</em> of the
        user in some order. However, the user does not pay equal attention to
        all posts. Instead, more attention is given to the posts on top of the
        feed while the posts which disappear <em>underneath the fold</em> are
        given very little attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence, a heuristic approach to seeking user attention would be to
        minimize the rank (\( r(t) \)) of our posts on the follower's feed.
        <span class="marginnote">The rank \( r(t) \) is the position of the
        latest post by a broadcaster on a follower's feed.</span>
      </p>

      <figure>
        <span class="marginnote">
          Feed of a follower contains broadcasts from several sources,
          including from a source interested in staying on top of the
          follower's feed.
        </span>
        <img src="img/when-to-post-problem-demo.svg" alt="When to post problem" class="full-width">
      </figure>

        <!--
        <label class="margin-toggle" for="fig-redqueen">⊕</label>
        <input id="fig-redqueen" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox">

          A bursty feed of a follower with the rank of the users.
        </span>
        -->

      <p>
        If the feeds are inverse-chronologically sorted, then the dynamics of the rank \( r(t) \) of the <span class="us">broadcaster</span> in the feed can be modeled using the following equation:
        <span class="marginnote">
          Our method can generalize to any ordering of
          posts as long as we can reverse-engineer the algorithm and write out
          the dynamics of \( r(t) \).
        </span>

        $$
        r(t+dt) = \left\{
          \begin{array}{ccccl}
            & (r(t)+1) & {\color{other} dM(t)} & {\color{us} (1-dN(t))} & \text{Increases by one}\\
          + & 0 & {\color{other}(1 - dM(t))} & {\color{us} dN(t)} & \text{Becomes zero}\\
          + & r(t) & {\color{other} (1 - dM(t))} & {\color{us} (1- dN(t))} & \text{Remains the same}
          \end{array}
          \right.
        $$

        where \( {\color{other} dM(t)}, {\color{us} dN(t)} \in \{0, 1\} \) denote the presence or absence of a
        <em>broadcast</em> in the respective point process at time \( t \).
      </p>

      <p>
        The evolution of \( \color{us} N(t) \) is under the control of the <span class="us">broadcaster</span>,
        whereas the \( \color{other} M(t) \) may behave in various ways:
        <span class="marginnote">
          <a href="http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/subtopic/view/smart-broadcasting-do-you-want-to-be-seen">Karimi et. al.</a> assume that the broadcasting frequency of <span class="other">other broadcasters</span> is piecewise constant.
        </span>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>It may be nearly constant (e.g. large number of diverse followees)</li>
        <li>It may have bursts (e.g. breaking news posts)</li>
        <li>It may be piecewise constant with some period (e.g. most followees
          are from a particular time zones)</li>
        <li>\( \ldots \)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Thanks to our novel formulation of the problem, our solution
        <span class="red-queen">RedQueen</span> is able to handle all of these
        cases, <em>without needing to infer the parameters of any process.</em>
      </p>

      <h2>Objective</h2>

      <p>
        Now one can attempt to optimize for many different kind of losses
        to find our optimal rate of posting. One such choice, taken by Karimi et. al.
        is to optimize for <em>Time spent in top-k</em>, wherein, they find the
        rates which maximize the time the broadcaster's posts spend with \( r(t) \lt k \).
        However, we choose the following quadratic loss function:

        <span class="marginnote">
          This objective can be generalized for multiple followers. For details, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05773">our paper</a>.

                \phi(r(t_f)) + \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \ell(r(\tau), u(\tau)) d\tau

      </p>

      <p>
        This function penalizes high ranks quadratically
        \( \frac{1}{2} s \,r^2(t) \)
        while also containing the term \( \frac{1}{2} q\,u^2(t) \), which
        trades off posting with a high frequency and maintaining a low rank.
      </p>

      <p>
        The \( s \) and the \( q \) denote the relative penalty of
        the rank we obtain and the amount of broadcasting we do.
        <span class="marginnote">The term \( s \) can be made a function of time, i.e. \( s(t) \), to
          change the <em>significance</em> of obtaining a high rank at time \( t \).
          Also, in case of multiple followers, the term \( s \) can be a vector, which can be used
          to weigh the ranks of the broadcaster on different follower's feeds differently.
          For details, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05773">our paper</a>.
        </span>

        <!-- The resulting loss function to optimize in a convex loss function. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        With this choice of the loss function, the optimization problem can be solved analytically.
        We arrive at the elegant solution:

        $$
        \overbrace{u(t)}^{\text{broadcast intensity}} = \sqrt{s/q}\,\underbrace{r(t)}_{\text{Rank in feed}}
        $$
      </p>

      <p>
        This function states that the rate at which <span class="us">the broadcaster</span> must post messages (i.e. the <em>urgency</em> of posting), should be proportional to how <em>bad</em> his rank \( r(t) \) is.
        Hence, he will have to post <em>faster</em> to stay where he original was (i.e. at the top).
      </p>

      <p>
        Determining the rate requires only knowing the rank of
        <span class="us">the broadcaster</span> on the feed(s) of his follower(s).
        This information can be calculated in \( \mathcal{O}(1) \) time, given
        the stream of posts from <span class="other">other broadcasters</span>,
        the sampling, as shown <a href="#sampling">below</a>, too takes only
        \( \mathcal{O}(1) \) time, making this an efficient online algorithm
        for determining when-to-post.

        Now that we know what how <span class="us">the broadcaster</span> should
        regulate his messages, we have to determine when exactly should he post.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, thanks to the superposition property of Poisson point processes
        we can treat each <em>jump</em> as the start of a new Poisson process.

      </figure>

      <p>
        Now to draw the time of first event for \( u(t) \), i.e. when <span class="us">our broadcaster</span> posts, we can draw samples from all point processes and take the minimum.

      </figure>

      <p>
        Since drawing one sample is an \( \mathcal{O}(1) \) operation, and we draw one sample each time <span class="other">other broadcasters</span> post, we only have to take \( \mathcal{O}(M(t_f)) \) samples.

      <p>
        We compared <span class="red-queen">RedQueen</span> against an Oracle
        and the state of the art and saw that our algorithm fared favourably.

        Tests were also conducted using real tweets from Twitter and over 2000 users.
        <span class="red-queen">RedQueen</span> was able to obtain better
        average rank as well as higher time in the top-1 compared to the real
        users as well as against the current state of the art.
