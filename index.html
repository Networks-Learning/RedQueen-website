      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        User attention is becoming a sparse commodity. This is evinced by the
        proliferation of studies which point to information overload or to the
        plethora of articles proclaiming to recommend when to post your messages
        to maximise the probability of your followers reacting to the post.
        <!-- Can give references here -->
      </p>

      <p>
        We will look at <span class="us">a broadcaster</span> who wants his
        posts to gain more attention on the feed of one follower and see how he
        can regulate his posting to do that.
      </p>

      <h2>Feeds in social media</h2>
      <p>
        Feeds in social media display posts of all <em>followees</em> of the
        user (the follower) in some order. However, the follower does not pay
        equal attention to all posts. Instead, more attention is given to the
        posts on top of the feed while the posts which disappear <em>underneath
          the fold</em> are given little attention.

        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us define the rank \( r(t) \) as the position of the <em>first</em>
        post by the broadcaster on the follower's feed. It is a measure of
        visibility of the broadcasters post. One way of seeking the follower's
        attention is to minimize the rank \( r(t) \).

        </span>
        -->

      <p>
        In order to minimize the rank, we first need to understand how it evolves.
        If the feeds are sorted by the time of the post, with most recent posts appearing on top, then the dynamics of the rank \( r(t) \) of the <span class="us">broadcaster</span> in the feed can be modeled using the following equation:
        <label class="margin-toggle" for="generalize-rank-algo">⊕</label>
        <input id="generalize-rank-algo" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox">
        $$
        r(t+dt) = \left\{
          \begin{array}{ccccl}
          & (r(t)+1) & {\color{other} dM(t)} & {\color{us} (1-dN(t))} & {\color{other} \text{Others post}}\\
          + & 0 & {\color{other}(1 - dM(t))} & {\color{us} dN(t)} & {\color{us} \text{Our broadcaster posts}}\\
          + & r(t) & {\color{other} (1 - dM(t))} & {\color{us} (1- dN(t))} & \text{No-one posts}
          \end{array}
          \right.
        $$

        where \( {\color{other} dM(t)}, {\color{us} dN(t)} \in \{0, 1\} \) denote the presence or absence of a
        <em>broadcast</em> in the respective point process at time \( t \).
        <span class="marginnote">
          Our method can generalize to any ordering of
          posts as long as we can reverse-engineer the algorithm and write out
          the dynamics of \( r(t) \).
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        The evolution of \( \color{us} N(t) \) is under the control of <span class="us">the broadcaster</span>,
        whereas the \( \color{other} M(t) \) may behave in various ways:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>It may be nearly constant (e.g. large number of diverse followees)</li>
        <li>It may have bursts (e.g. breaking news posts)</li>
        <li>It may be piecewise constant with some period (e.g. most followees
          are from a particular time zones)</li>
        <li>\( \ldots \)</li>
      </ul>

          </a> assume that the broadcasting frequency of
          <span class="other">other broadcasters</span> is piecewise constant.
        </span>

        Thanks to our novel formulation of the problem, our solution
        <span class="red-queen">RedQueen</span> is able to handle all of these
        cases, <em>without needing to perform any model inference using historical data for \( \color{other} M(t) \)</em>.

      <h2>Methodology</h2>

      <p>
        Given the dynamics of the rank and of <span class="others">other broadcasters</span>,
        as stochastic jump differential equations, we can attempt to find the optimal rate
        of posting for <span class="us">the broadcaster</span> \( u(t) \) by formulating it
        as a variable in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi%E2%80%93Bellman_equation#Extension_to_stochastic_problems">stochastic control problem</a>.
        However, before that, we have to choose a loss function which we will
        aim to optimize for.
      </p>

      <p>
        We choose the following loss function:

          In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05773">our paper</a>, we show
          that our approach, though optimizing for a different loss function,
          still outperforms the offline method.
        </span>

        This function penalizes high ranks \( \frac{1}{2} s \,r^2(t) \)
        as well as posting with high frequency \( \frac{1}{2} q\,u^2(t) \), with
        tunable weights \( s \) and \( q \) to trade off between them.

      <p>
        We integrate the this loss function over the desired interval
        \( [ t_0, t_j ] \) and, since the future is stochastic, we attempt
        to find the posting rate \( u(t) \) of <span class="us">the broadcaster</span>
        which minimizes the expectation of the integral.
      </p>

      <!--
      <p>
        The \( s \) and the \( q \) denote the relative penalty of
        the rank we obtain and the amount of broadcasting we do.

          change the <em>significance</em> of obtaining a high rank at time \( t \).
          Also, in case of multiple followers, the term \( s \) can be a vector, which can be used
          to weigh the ranks of the broadcaster on different follower's feeds differently.

      </p>
      -->

      <p>
        With this choice of the loss function, the optimization problem can be solved analytically by formulating the optimal cost-to-go, deriving a PDE using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi%E2%80%93Bellman_equation&wteswitched=1">Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation</a> and then solving it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, on solving the PDE, we arrive at the following elegant solution:

        $$
        \overbrace{u(t)}^{\text{broadcast intensity}} = \sqrt{s/q}\,\underbrace{r(t)}_{\text{Rank in feed}}
        $$
      </p>

      <p>
        This function states that the rate at which <span class="us">the broadcaster</span> must post messages (i.e. the <em>urgency</em> of posting), should be proportional to how <em>bad</em> his rank \( r(t) \) is.
        Hence, he will have to post <em>faster</em> to stay where he originally was (i.e. at the top).
      </p>

      <p>
        Determining the rate requires only knowing the rank of
        <span class="us">the broadcaster</span> on the feed(s) of his follower(s).
        This information can be calculated in \( \mathcal{O}(1) \) time, given
        the stream of posts from <span class="other">other broadcasters</span>,
        the sampling, as shown <a href="#sampling">below</a>, too takes only
        \( \mathcal{O}(1) \) time, making this an efficient online algorithm
        for determining when-to-post.

        Now that we know how <span class="us">the broadcaster</span> should
        regulate his messages, we have to determine when exactly should the next post be made.
      </p>

      <p>First, notice that \( u(t) \) changes only when \( r(t) \) changes and in steps of size \( \sqrt{{s}/{q}} \).</p>

      <p>
        Thanks to the superposition property of Poisson point processes
        we can treat each <em>jump</em> in \( u(t) \) as the start of a new Poisson process.

      <p>
        Now to draw the time of first event for \( u(t) \), i.e. when
        <span class="us">our broadcaster</span> posts, we can draw samples
        from all point processes and take the minimum.

          Since \( u(t) \) is a sum of several independent Poisson processes,

      <p>
        Since drawing one sample is an \( \mathcal{O}(1) \) operation, and we
        draw one sample each time <span class="other">other broadcasters</span>
        post, we only have to take \( \mathcal{O}(M(t_f)) \) samples.
